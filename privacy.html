                        <strong>1. I process the following (categories of) personal data</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>When you play my games, connect to a social networking site through our games, register an account, enter a promo code, or place an order, we process the following personal data when you consent:</p>
                    <p>&middot; Your IP address, and the country,</p>
                    <p>&middot; Your device type (for example, iPhone 7, Samsung Galaxy S7) and operating system version.</p>
                    <p>&middot; Your Game Center ID (for iOS games) or Google Play ID (for Android games).</p>
                    <p>&middot; When you connect to Facebook or Game Center, or other social platforms, I may access your profile, including your username and friends list.</p>
                    <p>&middot; For analytics, most, when you installed and played the game, your progress throughout the game, and events that are connected to your game-play. I generally cannot identify you with this data, but treat it the same as personal data.</p>
                    <p>&middot; For advertising, I may use collected IDFAs to (re)target users on advertising platforms.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>2. What (purposes) do I use the data for</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>I use this personal data to perform analytics for my games and allow third-parties to sell, buy and deliver advertizing in those games that display advertizing.</p>
                    <p>I use social network data to show you personalized content. For example, I might show a high score list with only your friends in it, or show your name or avatar on an in-game object.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>3. What is my legal basis for the processing</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>For both analytics and advertising I base the processing of personal data on the legitimate goal of improving my games. For analytics, this is my ability to analyze how players progress through my games to make them better, and to know my player-base on an aggregate level. For advertising, this is my ability to be able to off-set development costs and risk with advertizing income.</p>
                    <p>For the third-parties I use, their legitimate interest is to be able to offer me their services, and for advertising third-parties and advertisers to be able to show you advertising.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>4. Where do I obtain the data from (sources) </strong>
                    </p>

                        <strong>5. How long and where do I store data </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>I store the personal data that I collect for up to 1 month, and only aggregate data after that time. Aggregation data means that I can no longer look at data for individual players.</p>
                    <p>When a third-party service provider is a controller, they may keep data as well, either for a shorter or longer period.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>6. What safeguards have I taken to protect data</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, I have taken the following technical and organizational measures:</p>
                    <p>&middot; Access to my database and user accounts with third-party service providers is protected with access control.</p>
                    <p>&middot; Data sent from my games is encrypted in transit where technically possible.</p>
                    <p>I do not actively monitor the security of my databases and need to rely on our processors to notify me of any data breaches.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>7. Who I share data with</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>I share data with the following third-parties. These are either controllers, or processors acting on my behalf. I have linked to their respective policies and given a basic description of what they do:</p>
